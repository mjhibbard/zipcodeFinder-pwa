# zip-info-pwa

Built with Vue.js and Ionic4.

This is a simple progressive web app that pulls Zipcode information from the zippopotam api and displays some location information based on the zipcode entered.
It also checks for a valid zipcode and displays an alert when the zip is invalid or is not found (given a response status of more than 200).

This application has been deployed to Google's Firebase at <https://zipfinder-73c6c.firebaseapp.com>.
